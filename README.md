Provide a sentiment score/distribution and keyword insights.

🚀 Features
Text preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning, stopword removal).

Sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral).

Confidence scores for predictions.

Batch file processing (CSV/TXT).

Visualizations: sentiment distribution charts.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries:

pandas – data handling

scikit-learn or transformers – ML/NLP models

matplotlib / seaborn – visualization

Flask or Streamlit (if you built a web app)
